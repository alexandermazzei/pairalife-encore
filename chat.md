Here’s a concise, Carmack-style breakdown and next steps for setting up Encore with Cursor on your M1 Mac, based on the provided encore.md:
Key Points from encore.md:
Use TypeScript for most projects; Go only for max performance.
Install all tools natively for ARM64 (no Rosetta unless absolutely necessary).
Install Homebrew to /opt/homebrew, Node.js 18+ via NVM, Go via Homebrew, Docker Desktop for Apple Silicon, Encore CLI, and Cursor IDE.
Download and place the .cursorrules file in your project root for optimal Cursor AI integration.
Use Docker buildx for multi-platform builds if deploying containers.
For architecture errors, reinstall Encore for ARM64 or use Rosetta as a last resort.
Minimal, Sequential Setup Steps:
Confirm Homebrew is installed at /opt/homebrew and your shell profile is correct.
Install Node.js 18+ (ARM64) using NVM.
Install Go (ARM64) via Homebrew.
Install Docker Desktop for Apple Silicon.
Install Encore CLI (ARM64).
Install Cursor IDE.
Download .cursorrules and place in project root.
Verify everything is running natively (no x86_64 binaries).
Checkpoint:
Do you want to proceed with a step-by-step script/checklist for each of these, or do you need help with a specific step?
Let me know where you are in the process, and I’ll guide you through the next minimal step.
do it all for me

Understood. I’ll automate the full setup for Encore and Cursor on your M1 Mac, following the minimal, ARM64-native approach from the guide. This will include:
Homebrew (verify ARM64, /opt/homebrew)
Node.js 18+ via NVM (ARM64)
Go via Homebrew (ARM64)
Docker Desktop for Apple Silicon
Encore CLI (ARM64)
Cursor IDE
Downloading .cursorrules to your project root
Notes:
Docker Desktop and Cursor IDE require manual downloads (GUI interaction), but I’ll provide the commands and open the download pages for you.
No changes will be made to your .env or unrelated files.
I’ll pause after each logical step for confirmation, as per your rules.
[COMPLEX CHANGE]: This will touch multiple system-level tools and your project directory.
Magnitude: [MAJOR] (multiple installations, config changes)
Step 1: System Preparation and Homebrew Verification
Check if Homebrew is installed at /opt/homebrew (ARM64).
If not, install it.
Step 2: Node.js 18+ via NVM (ARM64)
Install NVM if missing.
Install Node.js LTS (18+) using NVM.
Step 3: Go via Homebrew (ARM64)
Install Go.
Step 4: Docker Desktop for Apple Silicon
Open the official download page for manual install.
Step 5: Encore CLI (ARM64)
Install Encore CLI.
Step 6: Cursor IDE
Open the official download page for manual install.
Step 7: .cursorrules
Download and place in your project root.
I’ll begin with Step 1 and pause for confirmation after Homebrew is verified/installed.
Proceeding to check/install Homebrew at /opt/homebrew…
Homebrew is currently installed at /usr/local/bin/brew, which is the x86_64 (Intel) location—not the recommended ARM64-native /opt/homebrew for M1 Macs.
Options:
For best performance and compatibility, you should install Homebrew natively for ARM64 at /opt/homebrew.
Keeping the Intel version may cause architecture issues with Encore and other tools.
Next Step:
Would you like me to install the ARM64-native Homebrew at /opt/homebrew?
This will not remove your existing Intel Homebrew, but will set up the correct version for Apple Silicon.
Reply with:
"Yes" to proceed with ARM64 Homebrew install.
"No" to skip and continue with your current setup (not recommended for Encore on M1).
i have a macbook pro m1 will that work on this 

Yes, a MacBook Pro with an M1 chip is fully supported for this setup. The guide in encore.md is specifically optimized for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs. The only critical requirement is to use ARM64-native versions of all tools (Homebrew, Node.js, Go, Docker, Encore CLI) for maximum performance and compatibility.
Key points for M1:
Install Homebrew to /opt/homebrew (not /usr/local).
Use ARM64-native Node.js, Go, and Docker.
Avoid running Encore or Node.js tools under Rosetta unless you hit a specific x86_64-only compatibility issue.
Next step:
Would you like to proceed with installing ARM64-native Homebrew at /opt/homebrew for your M1 Mac?
This is the recommended path for Encore and Cursor development on Apple Silicon.
Reply "yes" to proceed, or "no" to skip and use your current (Intel) Homebrew.
yes

The Homebrew ARM64 installation command did not execute as intended—likely due to shell/environment issues. No changes were made to your system.
Manual Step Required:
For best reliability, run the following command directly in your Terminal (not in PowerShell or within a non-standard shell):
Apply to encore
"
This will install Homebrew to /opt/homebrew for ARM64.
After installation, follow the on-screen instructions to add Homebrew to your shell profile (e.g., add to your ~/.zshrc).
Next Steps:
Run the above command in your Terminal.
Confirm Homebrew is installed at /opt/homebrew by running:
Apply to encore
version
Reply here once done, and I’ll proceed with Node.js (NVM) and the rest of the setup.
Checkpoint:
Let me know when ARM64 Homebrew is installed and ready, or if you encounter any issues.
[COMPLETE] ARM64-native Homebrew is now installed at /opt/homebrew and working correctly.
Next Step: Node.js 18+ via NVM (ARM64)
I will:
Check if NVM is installed.
If not, install NVM.
Use NVM to install the latest LTS (Node.js 18+) for ARM64.
I’ll pause after Node.js is installed and verified.
Proceeding to check/install NVM and Node.js…
NVM installation is in progress (or was started in the background).
Once NVM is installed, you’ll need to either restart your terminal or run the following to load NVM into your current shell:
Apply to encore
"
Next Steps:
Confirm NVM is available by running:
Apply to encore
nvm
It should output nvm.
Then, install Node.js LTS (18+) for ARM64:
Apply to encore
v
Checkpoint:
Let me know when Node.js is installed and node -v outputs a version (should be 18.x or higher), or if you hit any issues.
Once confirmed, I’ll proceed to Go installation.
[COMPLETE] Node.js (LTS, ARM64) is installed and working (v22.16.0).
Next Step: Install Go (ARM64) via Homebrew
I will:
Install Go using ARM64 Homebrew.
Verify the installation.
After this, I’ll pause for confirmation before proceeding to Docker Desktop.
Proceeding to install Go…
Go installation was attempted, but the output is unclear—likely due to shell/environment issues.
Please run the following in your terminal to confirm Go is installed and working:
Apply to encore
version
You should see output like: go version go1.xx.x darwin/arm64
Checkpoint:
Reply with the output of go version, or let me know if you encounter any issues.
Once Go is confirmed, I’ll guide you through Docker Desktop (Apple Silicon) installation.
Your Go installation is currently amd64 (Intel), not arm64 (Apple Silicon). For best performance and compatibility with Encore and Docker on your M1, you should use the ARM64-native Go binary.
Minimal Fix:
Uninstall the current Go version:
Apply to encore
go
Reinstall Go using ARM64 Homebrew:
Apply to encore
go
Confirm the architecture:
Apply to encore
version
The output should be: go version go1.xx.x darwin/arm64
Checkpoint:
Please run the above steps and reply with the new go version output.
Once Go is arm64, I’ll move to Docker Desktop setup.
Your Go installation is still amd64 (Intel). This means your shell is likely still using the Intel Homebrew or a previously installed Go binary.
To ensure you use the ARM64-native Go:
Uninstall all Go versions from both Homebrew locations:
Apply to encore
go
Remove any old Go binaries from your PATH:
Apply to encore
go
Ensure your shell is using ARM64 Homebrew:
Run this in your terminal:
Apply to encore
"
Add it to your ~/.zprofile if not already present.
Reinstall Go using ARM64 Homebrew:
Apply to encore
go
Restart your terminal (or run the eval command above again).
Verify Go is now ARM64:
Apply to encore
version
You should see: go version go1.xx.x darwin/arm64
Checkpoint:
Please follow these steps and reply with the new go version output.
Once Go is arm64, I’ll move to Docker Desktop setup.
Go is now fully uninstalled from your system (as expected). Next, let’s install the ARM64-native Go using your ARM64 Homebrew.
Run this command:
Apply to encore
go
After installation, verify with:
Apply to encore
version
You should see: go version go1.xx.x darwin/arm64
Checkpoint:
Reply with the output of go version once installed.
Once confirmed, I’ll move to Docker Desktop setup.
Go is installed via ARM64 Homebrew, but your shell still cannot find the go command. This usually means your PATH is not set up to include Homebrew’s bin directory.
Fix: Add Homebrew to your PATH
Run this command in your terminal:
Apply to encore
"
Then try:
Apply to encore
version
To make this permanent, add the following line to your ~/.zprofile:
Apply to encore
zprofile
Checkpoint:
Reply with the output of go version after running the above.
Once Go is working and shows darwin/arm64, I’ll move to Docker Desktop setup.
[COMPLETE] Go is now correctly installed as ARM64-native (go version go1.24.3 darwin/arm64), and your PATH is set up.
Next Step: Docker Desktop for Apple Silicon
Docker Desktop must be installed via the official GUI installer for Apple Silicon.
Here’s what to do:
Open the official Docker Desktop download page for Mac (Apple chip):
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
Download the “Mac with Apple chip” version.
Open the downloaded .dmg file and drag Docker to your Applications folder.
Launch Docker Desktop from Applications and complete any setup prompts.
Once Docker is running, verify in your terminal:
Apply to encore
version
You should see both client and server info, and the architecture should mention aarch64 or arm64.
Checkpoint:
Reply with the output of docker version once Docker Desktop is installed and running.
Once confirmed, I’ll proceed to Encore CLI installation.
[COMPLETE] Docker Desktop is installed and running natively on ARM64 (darwin/arm64, linux/arm64).
Next Step: Install Encore CLI (ARM64)
Run the following command to install the Encore CLI for ARM64:
Apply to encore
bash
After installation, reload your shell or run:
Apply to encore
"
Then verify installation:
Apply to encore
version
Checkpoint:
Reply with the output of encore --version once installed.
Once confirmed, I’ll guide you through installing Cursor IDE and setting up the .cursorrules file.
[COMPLETE] Encore CLI is installed and working (v1.48.3, ARM64).
Next Step: Cursor IDE Installation
Download Cursor IDE for Mac (Apple Silicon) from the official site:
https://www.cursor.so/download
Open the downloaded .dmg and drag Cursor to your Applications folder.
Launch Cursor IDE and complete any setup prompts.
After Cursor is installed and running:
Final Step: .cursorrules File Setup
Download the official Encore .cursorrules file to your project root:
Apply to encore
cursorrules
Confirm the file exists:
Apply to encore
cursorrules
Checkpoint:
Reply when Cursor IDE is installed and the .cursorrules file is present in your project root (or if you hit any issues).
Once confirmed, your Encore + Cursor setup will be complete and ready for high-performance development on your M1 Mac.
[COMPLETE]
The .cursorrules file is present in your project root, and all previous steps (Homebrew, Node.js, Go, Docker, Encore CLI) are correctly set up for ARM64 on your M1 Mac.
Your Encore + Cursor development environment is now fully configured and ready for high-performance, AI-assisted backend development.
Summary of what’s done:
ARM64-native Homebrew installed and in PATH
Node.js (LTS, ARM64) via NVM
Go (ARM64) via Homebrew, in PATH
Docker Desktop (Apple Silicon) installed and running
Encore CLI (ARM64) installed and working
Cursor IDE (manual install, assumed complete)
Official Encore .cursorrules file in project root
What’s next?
Open your project in Cursor IDE.
Start building with Encore and leverage AI features.
If you want to test Encore, run:
Apply to encore
run
For any new service or endpoint, follow Encore’s TypeScript patterns and use Cursor’s AI for rapid development.
If you need help with:
Creating your first Encore service or endpoint
Setting up a database or pub/sub
Writing tests or deploying
Just ask for the next step.
Would you like to proceed with a sample Encore endpoint, or is your setup complete for now?
Encore is working, but you don’t have an Encore app initialized in this directory yet.
You need to create a new Encore app to start building services.
Minimal next step:
Initialize a new Encore app in your current directory:
Apply to encore
init
Follow the prompts (choose a name, etc).
Once complete, you’ll have an encore.app file and a basic project structure.
Then you can run:
Apply to encore
run
Checkpoint:
Run encore app init and let me know when it’s done (or if you hit any issues).
Once initialized, I can guide you to create your first endpoint or service.
You’ve successfully logged into Encore Cloud.
You can now close this browser window and return to your terminal or Cursor IDE.
Next step:
If you haven’t already, run:
Apply to encore
init
in your project directory to initialize your Encore app.
Follow the prompts to set up your app (name, etc).
Once that’s done, you’ll be ready to start building services and endpoints.
Let me know when you’ve completed encore app init, or if you want help creating your first endpoint or service.
You’re at the language selection step for initializing your Encore app.
Recommended action:
Use the arrow keys to select TypeScript (as per best practices and your encore.md guide).
Press Enter to confirm.
After this, Encore will scaffold your project with the correct structure for TypeScript development.
Next steps after language selection:
Follow any additional prompts (app name, etc).
Once initialization is complete, you’ll see an encore.app file and a basic project structure.
You can then run:
Apply to encore
run
to start your local Encore dev server.
Let me know when initialization is complete, or if you want help creating your first endpoint or service!
You’ve selected TypeScript as your language.
Now, Encore is prompting you to enter an App Name.
Instructions:
Enter a name using only lowercase letters, digits, and dashes (e.g., my-backend, encore-demo, business-api).
Press Enter to confirm.
Once you provide the app name, Encore will finish initializing your project.
Next steps after entering the app name:
Wait for Encore to scaffold the project.
When complete, you’ll see new files like encore.app and a basic directory structure.
Then, run:
Apply to encore
run
to start your local Encore dev server.
Let me know when initialization is complete, or if you want help with your first endpoint or service!
[COMPLETE]
Your Encore app is now initialized as pairalife and connected to Encore Cloud.
What’s next:
You now have a valid Encore project structure in your directory.
You can start the local dev server with:
Apply to encore
run
Open Cursor IDE in this directory to leverage AI-assisted development.
Would you like to:
Create your first API endpoint (e.g., a simple “ping” or “hello world”)?
Set up a database or other service?
Get a tour of the Encore project structure?
Let me know your next goal, and I’ll guide you step-by-step.
Encore tried to start on port 4000, but that port is already in use (likely from a previous server or another process).
Minimal fix:
Start Encore on a different port (e.g., 4001):
Apply to encore
4001
This will launch your Encore app on http://127.0.0.1:4001.
If you want to free up port 4000:
Find the process using port 4000:
Apply to encore
4000
Kill the process (replace PID with the actual number):
Apply to encore
PID
Then you can run Encore normally:
Apply to encore
run
Checkpoint:
Let me know if you want to use a new port or free up 4000.
Once your server is running, I can help you create your first endpoint or service.
Encore failed to start because there is no package.json file in your project directory. Encore TypeScript projects require a package.json to define dependencies and scripts.
Minimal fix:
Create a package.json file:
Apply to encore
y
This will generate a basic package.json.
(Optional but recommended) Install Encore’s TypeScript SDK and types:
Apply to encore
node
Then try running Encore again:
Apply to encore
4001
Checkpoint:
Run the above commands and let me know if Encore starts successfully, or if you need help with the next step (like creating your first endpoint).
You’ve hit the classic Apple Silicon issue:
The Encore runtime binary is x86_64 (Intel), but your system and Node.js are ARM64.
Root cause:
Encore is trying to load an Intel-only binary (encore-runtime.node), but you need the ARM64 version for your M1 Mac.
Minimal, Efficient Fix
Uninstall any Intel (x86_64) Encore installations:
Apply to encore
encore
Reinstall Encore CLI for ARM64 (if not already):
Apply to encore
bash
Ensure your PATH prioritizes ARM64 Encore:
Apply to encore
"
Verify Encore is ARM64:
Apply to encore
encore
Output should include: arm64
Clean node_modules and reinstall encore.dev:
Apply to encore
dev
Try running Encore again:
Apply to encore
4001
Checkpoint:
Run the above steps and paste the output of file ~/.encore/bin/encore and your next encore run --port=4001 attempt.
If you still see an architecture error, let me know—there are fallback options (Rosetta, etc.), but this should resolve it for most M1 setups.
Let’s get you running natively and efficiently.
Perfect execution—your Encore CLI is now ARM64-native, and you’ve cleaned and reinstalled your dependencies.
Encore is now building and analyzing your application graph without any architecture errors.
If the process is still running:
Wait for Encore to finish starting up.
You should see a message like:
Apply to encore
4001
If you’re back at the prompt and don’t see errors:
Try opening http://127.0.0.1:4001 in your browser.
Or, if you want to confirm the server is running, check for the process:
Apply to encore
4001
Next steps:
If Encore is running, you’re ready to build your first endpoint or service.
If you want a minimal “hello world” endpoint, let me know and I’ll walk you through it.
If you see any new errors, paste them here and I’ll help you resolve them.
You are now running Encore natively and efficiently on your M1 Mac.
What would you like to build next?
Your browser shows “connection refused” for http://127.0.0.1:4001, which means the Encore server is not running or failed to start.
Let’s debug this step-by-step (Carmack-style, sequentially):
Check if Encore is still running in your terminal.
If it’s running, you should see log output and a message like:
Apply to encore
4001
If you’re back at the prompt with no errors, Encore likely exited.
Check for errors in the last Encore run.
Did you see any error messages after encore run --port=4001?
If so, paste them here.
Check if the port is in use:
Apply to encore
4001
If you see a process, Encore or something else may be using the port.
Try running Encore again and watch for output:
Apply to encore
4001
Copy and paste any output or errors you see.
Action:
Run encore run --port=4001 and carefully observe the output.
If you see errors, copy them here.
If it says the server is running, try the browser again.
Let’s get you to a running server—report what you see after the next run.
Your Encore development server is now running successfully on port 4001!
API URL: http://127.0.0.1:4001
Development Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:9400/pairalife-h5oi
If you visit http://127.0.0.1:4001 in your browser and see a blank or 404 page, that’s normal until you add your first API endpoint.
Next steps:
Open your project in Cursor IDE for AI-assisted development.
Would you like to create a minimal “hello world” endpoint to verify everything is working?
Or do you want to explore the Encore dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:9400/pairalife-h5oi?
Let me know your next goal, and I’ll guide you step-by-step.
You are now fully set up and ready to build!
You’re seeing:
endpoint not found on http://127.0.0.1:4001 (expected, since you have no endpoints yet)
The Encore Dev Dashboard is working at http://127.0.0.1:9400/pairalife-h5oi (good!)
This means your Encore backend is running perfectly. You just haven’t defined any API endpoints yet.
Next Step: Create a Minimal “Hello World” Endpoint
Create a file named api.ts in your project root.
Add this minimal Encore endpoint:
Apply to encore
;
Restart Encore:
Apply to encore
4001
Visit:
http://127.0.0.1:4001/hello
You should see:
Apply to encore
}
The endpoint will also appear in your Encore Dev Dashboard’s API Explorer.
Let me know when you’ve added the endpoint, or if you want a different example!
Once you see the hello message, your setup is 100% verified and ready for real development.
You’ve done it—your Encore “hello” endpoint is live and being hit successfully!
The logs confirm requests to the /hello endpoint, and Encore is serving responses as expected.
If your browser shows a blank page at http://127.0.0.1:4001/hello:
Try viewing the page source or using a tool like Postman/curl.
Or, open the Encore Dev Dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:9400/pairalife-h5oi and use the API Explorer to call /hello.
What this means:
Your full Encore + Cursor + M1 setup is working.
You can now build any backend service, API, or microservice you want.
Next steps:
Want to add parameters, connect a database, or build a more complex API?
Need help with Encore best practices, project structure, or deploying to the cloud?
Or just want to explore more Encore features?
Let me know your next goal, and I’ll guide you step-by-step.
You’re ready for real development—well done!
The 404 at http://127.0.0.1:9400/pairalife-h5oi/hello is expected—this is the Encore Dev Dashboard port, not your API port.
Key distinction:
API endpoints are served on:
http://127.0.0.1:4001/hello
Dev Dashboard (for docs, API explorer, traces, etc.) is on:
http://127.0.0.1:9400/pairalife-h5oi
How to test your endpoint:
Open: http://127.0.0.1:4001/hello
You should see your JSON response:
Apply to encore
}
To use the Dev Dashboard’s API Explorer:
Go to: http://127.0.0.1:9400/pairalife-h5oi
In the left sidebar, select your /hello endpoint (it should appear if your code is correct and Encore is running).
You can call the endpoint from the dashboard.
Summary:
404 on the dashboard for /hello is normal.
Always use the API port (4001) for your endpoints.
If /hello is not showing up in the API Explorer, make sure your api.ts is in the project root and Encore is running.
Let me know if you want to build more endpoints, connect a database, or need help with anything else!
You’ve got it!
Your /hello endpoint is now visible and callable in the Encore Dev Dashboard’s API Explorer, and traces confirm successful requests.
Your Encore + Cursor + M1 setup is 100% operational.
You can now:
Rapidly build and test new endpoints and services.
Use the API Explorer for live testing and trace inspection.
Leverage Cursor’s AI for code generation and refactoring.
Next steps (choose any):
Add more endpoints (CRUD, auth, etc.)
Connect a database (PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, etc.)
Set up pub/sub, object storage, or scheduled jobs
Write tests or deploy to the cloud
Let me know what you want to build next, or if you want a best-practices project structure or example!
You’re ready for real, high-performance backend development.
